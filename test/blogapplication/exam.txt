array_difference($array1, $array2) is an array function that takes two arrays as the parameters. This function returns those
elements that occurs in the first array and not in the second array.

For Ex.
$array1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];
$array2 = [1,2,3,7,8,9];

echo array_difference($array1, $array2);

this will result in a new array that will only contain [4,5,6];
